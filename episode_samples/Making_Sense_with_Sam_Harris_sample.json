  "html_body": "<p dir=\"ltr\">Sam Harris speaks with Congressman Ritchie Torres about the future of American politics. They discuss how growing up in public housing inspired Ritchie to pursue a career in politics, how the Biden administration became ideologically captured by the far-Left, how Democratic politicians are resisting Trump, why the Democrats should focus on governance rather than messaging, the war in Gaza, antisemitism on the Right and the Left, free speech on college campuses, Gen Z and hatred for America, social media, the importance of patriotism, the affordability crisis, AI and the future of work, potential Democratic candidates for the 2028 presidential election, and other topics.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Congressman Ritchie Torres</strong> is a fighter from the Bronx who has spent his entire life working for the community he calls home. Like many in the Bronx, poverty and struggle have never been abstractions to him. At 25, Ritchie became NYC&rsquo;s youngest elected official and the first openly LBGTQ person elected in the Bronx. He is a member of the Committee on Financial Services and the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Share this episode: <a href=\"https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/418-a-future-for-democrats\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/418-a-future-for-democrats</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Website: <a href=\"https://ritchietorres.house.gov/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">https://ritchietorres.house.gov/</a></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">X: <a href=\"https://x.com/RitchieTorres\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@RitchieTorres</a>, <a href=\"http://ritchietorres\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">@RepRitchie</a></p>",
